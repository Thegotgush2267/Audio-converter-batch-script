# Audio-converter-batch-script
This is a windows batch script that converts audio files using ffmpeg

make sure you have ffmpeg installed
Theres a folder Which has instructions on how to install ffmpeg

Once FFmpeg is installed make sure its added to path
To do that:
Open a NEW terminal 
in that new terminal type  "ffmpeg -version"
if theres no errors youre good

Once ffmpeg is installed fully run the "Converter.bat"
it will scan the folder you run it in for audio files
choose the audio file you need to convert

Enjoy!

NOTE; The "Software" only scans the folder its in and not the entire drive
